Introduction\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_1197/img/google_play_store.png\" alt=\"Google Play logo\"></p>\n<p>Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be very lucrative from the business standpoint. Specifically, Android is expanding as an operating system and has captured more than 74% of the total market<sup><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009\">[1]</a></sup>. </p>\n<p>The Google Play Store apps data has enormous potential to facilitate data-driven decisions and insights for businesses. In this notebook, we will analyze the Android app market by comparing ~10k apps in Google Play across different categories. We will also use the user reviews to draw a qualitative comparision between the apps.</p>\n<p>The dataset you will use here was scraped from Google Play Store in September 2018 and was published on <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps\">Kaggle</a>.
